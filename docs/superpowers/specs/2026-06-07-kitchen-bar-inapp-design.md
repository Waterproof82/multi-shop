# Design: In-App Kitchen & Bar Order Management

**Date:** 2026-06-07
**Replaces:** Telegram-based kitchen/bar order flow
**Scope:** Phase 1 — Waiter banner badges + Kitchen/Bar pages

---

## Context

Currently, kitchen and bar order management is handled via Telegram:
- Kitchen receives comida orders with Anotado/Preparado buttons
- Bar receives bebida orders with Servido button
- Bar receives a "preparado alert" when kitchen marks food as ready

This design replaces Telegram with in-app UX, keeping the same state machine but surfacing it in dedicated pages accessible from the waiter banner.

---

## Phase 1 Scope

1. **Waiter banner:** two new buttons (Cocina + Bebidas) with live badge counters
2. **Kitchen page:** `/waiter/kitchen` — list of active comida orders
3. **Bar page:** `/waiter/bar` — list of active bebida orders
4. **API:** `GET /api/waiter/orders/counts` — polling endpoint for badge data

Telegram integration for mesa orders is removed in this phase. Telegram for other order types (tienda, recogida, delivery) is NOT affected.

---

## Architecture

Same pattern as the rest of the waiter API:
`API Route (Zod) → Use Case → Repository`

No Supabase Realtime. All live updates via polling (3s interval). This avoids concurrent WebSocket connection costs on Supabase.

---

## 1. Waiter Banner Changes

### New buttons

Two buttons added to the right side of the banner, before the cart button:

- Button 1: Kitchen (UtensilsCrossed icon or similar)
- Button 2: Bar (wine glass / drink icon)

Click navigates to `/waiter/kitchen` or `/waiter/bar` respectively.

Both buttons are always visible when the waiter is logged in (regardless of current pathname, unlike the cart button which is hidden on `/waiter`).

### Badge counters (3 per button)

Each button displays three inline badge circles:

| Badge | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Total | Neutral (white/dim) | Active orders of that type not yet completed |
| Listos | Green | Orders ready to be picked up / served |
| Retenidos | Orange | Deferred items (items_diferidos) pending release |

Badges with count 0 can be hidden or shown as dimmed — decided at implementation.

### Sound (Web Audio API)

A ring sound plays when:
- The **total** counter increases (new order arrived)
- The **listos** counter increases (kitchen marked food as preparado)

Detection: compare previous poll values with current values. If either increases, trigger the sound. No external audio asset needed — generated via Web Audio API oscillator.

### Polling

`GET /api/waiter/orders/counts` called every 3 seconds while the waiter banner is mounted. Stopped when the component unmounts. Uses `cache: 'no-store'`.

---

## 2. API Endpoint

### `GET /api/waiter/orders/counts`

**Auth:** waiter JWT (same as all `/api/waiter/*` routes)
**Derives:** `empresa_id` from JWT

**Response:**
```json
{
  "cocina": {
    "total": 4,
    "listos": 1,
    "retenidos": 2
  },
  "bebidas": {
    "total": 3,
    "listos": 0,
    "retenidos": 1
  }
}
```

**Count logic:**

| Counter | Source | Condition |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| cocina.total | pedidos | has comida items, estado != final state, mesa_sesion active |
| cocina.listos | pedidos | has comida items, estado = 'preparado' |
| cocina.retenidos | mesa_sesiones.items_diferidos | items of tipo=comida across all active sessions |
| bebidas.total | pedidos | has bebida items, estado != final state, mesa_sesion active |
| bebidas.listos | pedidos | has bebida items, estado = 'servido' or equivalent ready state |
| bebidas.retenidos | mesa_sesiones.items_diferidos | items of tipo=bebida across all active sessions |

Exact estado values confirmed against DB schema at implementation time.

## 3. Kitchen Page — `/waiter/kitchen`

### Layout

Single vertical list, ordered by arrival time (oldest first).

Color legend fixed at the top — shows which color corresponds to each elapsed-time threshold:

| Color | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|
| Default (neutral) | 0–10 min |
| Yellow | 10–20 min |
| Orange | 20–30 min |
| Red-orange | 30–45 min |
| Red | 45–60 min |
| Deep red / alert | 60+ min |

Each order row changes color automatically as time elapses since the order was placed.

### Order row

Each row displays:
- Order number + table name/number
- List of comida items (with quantities and complements)
- Elapsed timer (live, updated every second)
- Color derived from elapsed time

### Interaction — swipe right to left

Swipe advances the order state:
- `nuevo` → `anotado`
- `anotado` → `preparado`

On reaching `preparado`:
- Row disappears from the active list
- Order is marked as "listo para recoger" (triggers the green Listos badge on the waiter banner)
- This is the event that plays the ring sound on the waiter's device

### Polling

Page polls `GET /api/waiter/kitchen/orders` every 3 seconds to refresh the list.

---

## 4. Bar Page — `/waiter/bar`

### Layout

Same structure as kitchen page. Single vertical list ordered by arrival time.

Same color-by-elapsed-time system and legend.

Two types of items appear in this list:
1. **Bebida orders** — drink items from active pedidos
2. **"Listo para recoger" alerts from kitchen** — when kitchen marks comida as preparado, bar gets an alert row showing which food items are ready to be picked up and served

### Order row

Each row displays:
- Order number + table
- List of bebida items (or comida items marked ready, for kitchen alerts)
- Elapsed timer + color

### Interaction — swipe right to left

- Bebida row: `nuevo` → `servido` → row disappears
- Kitchen alert row: swipe to confirm pickup → row disappears

### Polling

Page polls `GET /api/waiter/bar/orders` every 3 seconds.

---

## 5. State Machine

```
COCINA:
nuevo → anotado → preparado (disappears, triggers "listo para recoger" alert in bar)

BAR:
nuevo → servido (disappears)
kitchen-alert → recogido (disappears)
```

---

## 6. Telegram Removal (mesa orders — complete removal)

**All** Telegram integration for mesa order management is removed. No Telegram messages are sent, edited, or deleted as part of the mesa order lifecycle. No Telegram buttons or state transitions exist in this flow.

### Outbound calls removed (no longer sent)

- `sendTelegramForMesa` — was called on mesa pedido creation (comida items)
- `sendTelegramBebidasInfo` — was called on mesa pedido creation (bebida items)
- `sendTelegramPreparadoAlert` — was called when kitchen marked comida as preparado
- `editTelegramForMesa` — was called when waiter removed comida items from an order
- `editTelegramBebidasInfoForMesa` — was called when waiter removed bebida items
- `deleteMessage` — was called to clean up Telegram messages on various events
- `sendTelegramPagoMesaCompleto` — was called when mesa payment completed (includes "Cerrar mesa" button)

### Inbound webhook handlers removed or updated

The Telegram webhook at `/api/telegram/webhook` handles incoming button presses. The following callback actions are removed for mesa orders:
- `anotado:<pedidoId>` — kitchen acknowledged order
- `preparado:<pedidoId>` — kitchen marked order ready
- `servido:<pedidoId>` — waiter marked drinks as served
- `cerrar_mesa:<sesionId>` — close mesa session from Telegram

These state transitions now happen exclusively through the in-app kitchen/bar pages.

### What stays

Telegram integration for **non-mesa** order types is untouched:
- `tienda` orders
- `recogida` orders
- `delivery` orders
- Any `sendTelegramWithInlineButtons` / `sendTelegramWithQuickReplies` flows

### DB columns

`telegram_message_id` and `telegram_bebidas_message_id` on `pedidos` become unused for new orders. They are not deleted (non-destructive preference).

---

## 7. Out of Scope (this phase)

- Telegram removal for non-mesa order types
- Push notifications (browser/mobile)
- Supervisor/kitchen display screen (separate dedicated screen, future phase)
- Historical order view / completed orders history
- Manual time assignment per order
